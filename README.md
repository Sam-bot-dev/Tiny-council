## 🚀 Overview

**Tiny Council** is an experimental **multi-agent AI architecture** where multiple autonomous AI agents collaborate, debate, and challenge each other to arrive at high-quality, explainable decisions.

Instead of relying on a single AI response, Tiny Council forms a **council of experts**, each with a distinct role — mimicking how real-world engineering teams think.

---

## 🧠 Why Tiny Council?

Traditional AI systems:
- Provide single-point answers
- Lack internal critique
- Hide reasoning paths

**Tiny Council introduces:**
- 🗣️ Inter-agent debate
- ⚖️ Conflict-driven reasoning
- 🔍 Explicit critique and validation
- 🧩 Consensus-based decision making

This makes the system **more robust, explainable, and realistic**.

## 👥 Council Agents (v1)

| Agent | Role |
|-----|-----|
| 🧠 Planner | Breaks down the problem and proposes a solution |
| 🔎 Critic | Challenges assumptions, finds flaws and risks |
| 📚 Domain Expert | Ensures factual and technical correctness |
| 🧩 Synthesizer | Merges arguments into a final response |

Each agent operates independently and communicates through a structured debate loop.
